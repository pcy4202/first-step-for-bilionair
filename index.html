    <h2>Review for country food by native food fighter</h2>
    <p>The Food Reviewer had a humble pudgy origin, starting off innocent enough and was once human like you or me. Just a mere 10 year-old shoveling down chicken mcnuggets in a mall while shakily filming his exploits to then declare "it's a buy". He quickly rose to popularity through his nonstop random editing choices which never stayed consistent. Another contributing factor to his fame was the surprising viral nature of his fruit gushers review, it had reached half a million views before he decided to go apeshit and delete all of his videos, I mean, before he got "hacked".
