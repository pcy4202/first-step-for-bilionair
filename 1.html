    <h2>Review for korean food in US(Korean)</h2>
    <p>For a quick bite of Seoul, craft beers and galbi tacos will suffice for day 1, but to fully indulge in authentic Korean food—that requires a whole different set of cutlery and table manners.</p> <p>As much as Koreans are eager to embrace American and European cuisines, we are dead serious about Korean food and eating in general. Walk into any restaurant in the city for a simple kimchi jjigae, and you'll find yourself eating through a table adorned with at least four banchan side dishes.
    Korean food is not just about massive servings of savory broths, <a href="https://m.post.naver.com/viewer/postView.nhn?volumeNo=29293647&memberNo=1642904&vType=VERTICAL" target="_blank" title="불고기 맛집">barbeque</a>, and soul food, but it's also all about the clustered tables, side dishes you never ordered, and shouting for a refill from an "imo," an older and friendlier version of that girl next door.</p><p> In Korea, everyone including your waitress and beyond is your sister and auntie. In turn, you are not a mere customer, but a son and daughter to be fed and tended to. So put down those burgers and get yourself to a Korean restaurant tonight—you'll find no better Korean food in the world than the stuff right here. Here's a list of some of our favorites.</p>
